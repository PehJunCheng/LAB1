# Library Book Reservation and Collection System

## Project Description

The Library Book Reservation and Collection System aims to enhance book borrowing from public libraries through modern technology and automation. Users can reserve and select books online, specifying their preferred library branch and pickup date. Reservations are valid for 5 days, after which uncollected books are automatically cancelled. Each book has an 18-day loan period, extendable once by 7 days. Users are limited to borrowing 10 books at a time. Overdue books incur a $0.15 fine per day. To collect reserved books, users scan their SP Student Card barcode, authenticate, settle fines through the RFID card reader, and retrieve books. This streamlined process not only encourages book reading but also ensures efficient authentication, payment, and book dispensing for an enhanced library experience.
